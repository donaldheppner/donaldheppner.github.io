I lead Avanade's Digital Studio in Raleigh, North Carolina, from where we help clients
deliver well designed and well engineered custom software solutions. My focus is on meeting
clients where they're at in their digital transformation journey and helping them make the
right investments in software and technology to reach current and future goals.

Outside of work I still love tinkering with software, but also being a dad/husband and
turning wood.
